    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I just wanna be clear…this spicy fried chicken sandwich 
        isn't supposed to taste like anything you order from a drive-thru menu.
        It was definitely inspired by a few different fast food spots, but that's about it.
        We're using dark meat here. I prefer dark meat for just about anything lol, but especially this sandwich. 
        That juicy meat literally melts in your mouth.

   <li> 2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
    
</ul>


<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p> 
    You’ll need a medium-sized pot or deep fryer to cook the chicken. You could also shallow-fry it in a cast iron skillet. 
I also recommend a wire rack to go inside of a baking sheet, two if you have them. 
The above mentioned spices are what made this chicken sandwich so amazing. Feel free to use whatever you have, though.
</p>
<h4>For the chicken marinade</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Sprinkle equal amounts kosher salt and sugar all over the chicken, then place it into a large ziploc bag.</li>
    <li>Pour the pickle juice and buttermilk mixture over the chicken, massaging each piece through the bag.</li>
    <li>Squeeze any excess air out before sealing.</li>
    <li>Refrigerate 4 hours or overnight.</li>
</ol>
    <h4>For the pickles</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a medium-sized pot, bring the vinegar and sugar to a boil for 2 minutes, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. </li>
    <li>Taste it, and determine if you’d like it to be a bit sweeter. </li>
    <li> Pour hot mixture over sliced cucumbers and set aside at room temperature.</li>
    <li>Make this at LEAST 2 hours before you plan on eating them, or a day ahead. They can be stored in your refrigerator for up to a month.</li>
       
</ol>

    
     <h4>For the spicy mayo</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Mix both ingredients until combined.</li>
    <li> Taste and adjust as needed.</li> 
</ol>    
    
   <h4> For the wet dredge</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Whisk the buttermilk, egg whites, kosher salt, and hot sauce together until combined. Set aside.
</ol>  
    
    <h4>For the dry breading mixture</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk all ingredients together in a medium bowl, and set aside.</li>
</ol>

    
    <h4>For cooking the chicken & assembly</h4>
<ol>
<li>Remove chicken from fridge an hour before you plan to fry, so that they come to room temp.</li> 

<li>Place marinated chicken in a small colander in the bottom of your clean kitchen sink and gently, WITH A LOW STREAM, rinse most of the marinade off, careful not to splash 
    raw chicken juice everywhere. </li>

<li>Dip the thighs into the egg white/buttermilk (wet dredge) mixture, let the excess drip off. </li>
<li> Then, coat it evenly in the flour mixture. </li>
<li>  Lay the breaded chicken on a wire rack. </li>
<li> Meanwhile, heat the oil to 345°. You can use a dutch-oven, deep fryer, or cast-iron skillet to fry. </li>
<li>   Right before the oil hits proper temp, dunk the thighs back in the flour mixture one more time. </li>
<li>  Dust off the excess then immediately fry until golden brown or unto the internal temperature reaches 175°F on an instant-read thermometer — about 8 minutes, depending. When in doubt, use an instant-read thermometer.</li>
<li> Remove the chicken from the hot oil and let it drain and rest for about 5 minutes on a wire rack, 
<li> which helps avoid them steaming and sogging up. </li>

<li>Meanwhile, butter and toast your brioche buns. Assemble your sandwiches and enjoy!</li>

</ol>
