        Description
    </h2>
    <p>
        My daughter and I are fairly <b><i>OBSESSED</i></b> with the Biscoff cookie butter spread. 
        I mean, it is ridiculously addictive! 
        If you are not familiar with Biscoff spread, it is a creamy delight made with Lotus Biscoff cookies.

        Like the speculoos cookies (or biscuits, if you prefer) the spread tastes of caramel and cinnamon and is indescribably delicious!

    <h2>
        Ingredients
    </h2>
    <h3>For the brownies</h3>
<ul>
    <li>200 g (7oz | 7/8 cup) unsalted butter cubed</li>
    <li>200 g (1 ⅓ cups) dark chocolate chips (or chopped chocolate)</li>
    <li>200 g (1 cup) sugar</li>
    <li> 4 large eggs</li>
    <li>125 g (1 cup) flour plain /all purpose</li>
    <li>50 g (¼ cup) unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>½ tsp salt</li>
</ul>
    <h3>Topping</h3>
<ul>
    <li>60 g (⅔ cup) Biscoff spread smooth or crunchy</li>
    <li>Biscoff biscuits</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
    <li> Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) 160°C (325°F) Fan Setting. 
    Line a 9×9 inch brownie tin with baking paper letting the edges hang over the edge.</li>

    <li>Put the chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl and heat for 30 second bursts, 
    stirring in between, until melted. 
    Alternatively you can use the double boiler method: place the bowl over a saucepan of
    barely simmering water and the chocolate and butter to melt gradually.</li>
    
    <li>Place the sugar and eggs in a large bowl and use a hand whisk to mix together until frothy.</li>
    
    <li>Stir in the melted chocolate/butter mixture until thoroughly combined.</li>
    
    <li>Sift in the flour, cocoa powder and salt.
    Use a spatula to fold the dry ingredients into the batter until no dry streaks remain. 
    You should have a glossy thick batter.</li>

    <li>Warm the Biscoff spread in the microwave for 20 seconds and stir until smooth. 
    Drizzle over the brownie batter in three parallel lines and use a knife to swirl this into the batter.</li>
    
    <li>Add the Biscoff biscuits, pressing them lightly into the batter so they stick.</li>
    
    <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes until the edges are set but the middle is still a little squidgy.</li>

    <li>Allow the brownies to cool before cutting. 
    If you cut them straight out of the oven they are likely to fall apart – so be patient!</li>

    <li>Remove the brownies from the tin using the paper lining to lift them out.
    Use a large serrated knife to cut the brownies into squares (you will get about 16 small squares).</li>
    </ol>
